# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## Overview
the purpose of this analysis was to determine which machine learning models are best at predicting credit risk. Then we used that information to judge whether combinatorial approach is better than resampling.
## Results
* Naive randomg sampling recall score was .66 and precision was .99
* SMOTE was .66 recall score and .99 precision score
* Under sampling was .45 recall and .99 precision
* Combination was .6 recall and .99 precision
* Balanced was .91 recal and .99 precision
* Easy ensemble was .94 and .99

## Summary
based on the scores provided the Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier would be the best model to use as it had the better scores.
